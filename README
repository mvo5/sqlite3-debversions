This is a simple extension for sqlite to perform sort by
debian version number. A example should demo how it works:


# load extension
sqlite> .load "/usr/lib/sqlite3/debversions.so"

# create table
sqlite> insert into versions values("1.0-1");
sqlite> insert into versions values("1.0-1~ppa1");

# run with the custom collate
sqlite> SELECT version FROM versions ORDER BY version COLLATE debversion_compare;
